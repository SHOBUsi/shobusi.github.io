# Tor Traffic Analysis Research

## Objective
Analyze the feasibility and limitations of traffic analysis attacks on the Tor network.

## Environment
- Shadow network simulator
- Controlled Tor network setup

## Techniques Studied
- Website fingerprinting
- Flow correlation attacks

## Key Findings
- Real-world deanonymization is difficult due to network noise and routing diversity.
- Simulation fidelity gap limits experiment accuracy.
- Ethical and infrastructure constraints restrict real-world testing.

## Skills Gained
- Network traffic analysis
- Cybersecurity research methodology
- Ethical security experimentation
